# Task Board


## Overview
I wanted to make a simple task board to keep track of task progression. 
To keep track of the progress there are three lanes labeled with three different progress points.
Tasks also change color based on their progression.

## Function / How to use
Upon Loading the page you'll be presented with a blank task board.

* After pressing the "Add Task" button you'll be presented with a form that's nested in a modal.

* Upon completion of the form the task will appear in the 'to-do' section.
* You can drag the task into the other lanes and they will stay there after refreshing the page.
* If the task is late the color of the card will be Red, if its due tomorrow the card will be Yellow.
* If the task is finished the card will be Green, if it doesn't meet any of the previous criteria the default will be Blue.
